# ðŸ’° Finance Tracker App (Built with AWS)

This is a **simple finance tracking web app** built entirely on AWS using a **CI/CD pipeline with AWS Amplify**, **API Gateway**, **DynamoDB**, and **Lambda** by Akash bartwal E22CSEU0297
Aryan Raina E22CSEU0291


## ðŸ“Š Features
- Users can **add expenses** and **update budgets**
- Data is sent through **API Gateway** to **DynamoDB**
  - Expenses and Budgets are stored in separate tables
- A **Lambda function** (triggered via Lambda Function URL) pulls budget + expense data, analyzes it, and returns results to the frontend
- Results include:
  - Budget vs. Actual
  - Top 5 most bought items
  - Projected spending for the month
  - Alerts for overspending
- All changes to the app trigger **automatic deployments via AWS Amplify** from the GitHub repo.
